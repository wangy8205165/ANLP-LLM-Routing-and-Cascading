The most relevant section is section 1(e) and section 8. Section 1(e) states that \"Confidential Information shall not include information which: (e) is independently developed by Recipient without the use of the Confidential Information.\" \n\nSection 8 states that \"The foregoing obligations of all Parties shall continue for a period of two (2) years from the date of last disclosure of Confidential Information by either party, unless a specific portion of the Confidential Information disclosed becomes generally known to the public before the expiration of such two (2) year period through no fault of the Receiving Party.\"\n\nAlthough the section 8 does not mention about independent development of information, the section 1(e) does. This means that the agreement does allow the Receiving Party to independently develop information similar to Confidential Information, as long as it is without the use of the Confidential Information. \n\nTherefore, the hypothesis is Entailment.",
