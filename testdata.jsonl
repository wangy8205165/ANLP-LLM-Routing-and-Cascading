I They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.  In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the  timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its  quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by  power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free  swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension. They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such  bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting  Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody  from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were  pseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel  nor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to  remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned  up at all.  In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations  before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible  in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to  his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.  The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them  back. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him  through decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards. But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had  plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited  crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or  three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.  He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the  Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long  haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of  space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,  boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one  room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in  autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to  find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like  Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a  mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy  beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n\nToday we've reached the point where no one  need face danger—ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the  fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\" His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \" Let's  leave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the  point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will  take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate  pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next  explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been  increasingly hard to come by—even though in  our  minds, Hans, we are  near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so  spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take  hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated  to the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be  that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies  on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space  Exploration. \"  \" So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.  \" So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement! \"  \"Now we are getting to matters. \" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement. Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his  face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \" And do not the ends  justify the means? \"  Gubelin blinked at him.  The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have  failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read  of the sailor and his way of life?\"  \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to  do with it?\" \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more  than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,  tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never  heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his  birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at  sea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out  for years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk  of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be  one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and  heading home.\n\nThe one short drink would lead to another. And morning  would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in  jail. So back to sea he'd have to go.\" Gubelin grunted bitterly. \" Unfortunately, our present-day sailor  can't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd  personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over  the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\" He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his  universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted. \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,  nobody can, ah,  con you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever  our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\" The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern  methods, my dear chap.\" II Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any  excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age  of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't  been a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his  name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated. When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications  were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in  the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training  for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had  taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed  the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It  had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty  take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run. Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,  a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of  dangers met and passed. Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented  him from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor  needs again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.  He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't  any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the  reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either.\n\n\"  \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone  such that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having  met him.  Si Pond was surprised. \" Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of  bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under  him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it. \"  \"  Academician  Gubelin? \" she said. \"You just call him  Doc  ?\" Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have  much time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like  that. But how come you cried?\" She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,  as though avoiding his face. \" I ... I suppose it was that speech  Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in  your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the  planets....\"  \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon. \"  \"... and he said all those things about man's conquest of space. And  the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact  that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole  world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\" Si grunted. \" Yeah. That's all part of the Doc's scheme to get me to  take on another three runs. They're afraid the whole department'll be  dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning  Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,  it'd take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.  So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they're both trying to  pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration  Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their  ships. It's kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those  spaceships costs?\"  \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don't think it's funny at all.\" Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\" Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I'd love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"  \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of  the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you  know so much about it? You don't meet many people who are interested  in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like. Think it's kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of  materials and all and keep the economy going. \"  Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I've been a space fan all my life. I've  read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots  and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you'd  say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\" Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it's kind of funny. I was  never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested  after my first run and I found out what space cafard was. \"  She frowned. \"I don't believe I know much about that.\" Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had  ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \" Old Gubelin  keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper  articles. Says there's enough adverse publicity about space exploration  already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship's crammed  tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there's  precious little room in the conning tower and you're the only man  aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there's a whole  flock of people aboard, there won't be any such thing as space cafard, but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond's mouth began to tic  and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\n", "question": "Why is Si retirement so significant to the Space Exploration Team? \n\n (A) There aren’t enough working people in the world. They won’t be able to find a replacement.\n (B) As one of two remaining spacemen, it would likely mean the defunding and shut down of the Space Exploration Team.\n (C) Training new spacemen is costly and time consuming. They won’t have anyone else ready after him.\n (D) His retirement may inspire others to stop working as well, which would be hugely detrimental as most people don't feel the drive to work as is.", "output": "Training new spacemen is costly and time consuming.
